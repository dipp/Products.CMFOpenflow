Applications

  In the Applications page you can define applications the activities in the process can use.
  Each activity of a process will have one application for doing the activity job.
  The application will be started when a user selects a workitem pending on the activity.

  Usually an application consists of one or more forms the user has to fill-in and submit.
  But anything referrable by an URL can be used as an application for the activities.
  The URL will be invoked upon application start.
