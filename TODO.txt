todo:

    * Rewrite History.pt with new getUserActions methods

    * In workitem class make coerence with 'kind' and others attributes

    * In todolist separate workitem assigned to the user and unassigned

    * is it correct to have a std application activity with no application assigned?!? 
       
       * if no app. name provided in activity form when is std application, it assign '' (two apicets)

    * add OFreports module in cvs (!)

    * Application url should be transformed in an espression (tal or python) that will be evaluated, not a "static url"

    * Differentiate actor and assigned_user (use assigned to a workitem)
